We value collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement. 

Our postmortem workflow includes knowledge-sharing at every stage. 


## Postmortem triggers

Postmortem triggers can make it easy and fast for a team to know when to do a postmortem writeup.

Postmortem triggers can include:

 * Any user-visible issues, such as unexpected outages or errors.
  
 * Any on-demand intervention, such as by engineers or executives.
 
 * Any manual incident discovery, because this shows we need monitoring.

 * Any request by a stakeholder for a postmortem, or review, or mitigation.


## Blameless postmortems

Blameless postmortems focus on the incident's symptoms, causes, and treatments, rather than focus on blaming a person or a group of people.

Blameless postmortems start by affirming that everyone has good intentions, and does their best they can at the time, with the information they have at the time.


## Postmortem templates

Postmortem templates can help a team cover the important areas efficiently.

Postmortem templates can include:

  * Stakeholders: who is involved, such as users, employees, partners, specific people, etc.

  * Symptoms: what is going wrong on the surface, such as the users' perspectives, or triggers, or alerts, etc.

  * History: any background information that is relevant, such as prior similar issues, or reports, or references, etc.

  * Diagnosis: what is going wrong under the surface, such as the root causes, or cascading causes, etc. 

  * Treatment: what we're doing to make it better, such as action items, to do lists, mitigations, etc.
