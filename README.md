# Issues

Issues can be bug reports, trouble tickets, programmer postmortems, group restrospectives, etc.; this page describes how our team uses issues as a way to improve communication and success.

Contents:
* [Issue templates](#issue-templates)
* [Postmortem triggers](#postmortem-triggers)
* [Blameless postmortems](#blameless-postmortems)

We value collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement. 

Our issue workflow includes knowledge-sharing at every stage. 


## What is an issue?

For our teams the word "issue" is a generic catch all that includes for example:

* A bug report
* A ticket in a tracking tool
* A task in a to-do list
* A use case in a project plan
* A user email that we want to handle
* A feedback comment that we want to handle
* Etc.


## Issue templates

Issue templates can help a team cover important areas efficiently and succinctly.

Our issue template uses:

  * Participants a.k.a. Px: who is involved, such as users, employees, partners, specific people, etc.

  * Symptoms a.k.a. Sx: what is going wrong on the surface, such as the users' perspectives, or triggers, or alerts, etc.

  * History a.k.a. Hx: relevant background information, such as prior similar issues, or reports, or references, etc.

  * Diagnosis a.k.a. Dx: what is going wrong under the surface, such as the root causes, or cascading causes, etc. 

  * Fracture a.k.a. Fx: what's broken, such as a failed part, or crashed application, or stuck process, etc. 
  
  * Treatment a.k.a. Tx: what we're doing to make it better, such as action items, to do lists, mitigations, etc. 

Our issue template is this file: [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md)


## Postmortem triggers

Postmortem triggers can make it easy and fast for a team to know when to do a postmortem writeup.

Postmortem triggers can include:

 * Any user-visible issues, such as unexpected outages or errors.
  
 * Any on-demand intervention, such as by engineers or executives.
 
 * Any manual incident discovery, because this shows we need monitoring.

 * Any request by a stakeholder for a postmortem, or review, or mitigation.


## Blameless postmortems

Blameless postmortems focus on the incident's symptoms, causes, and treatments, rather than focus on blaming a person or a group of people.

Blameless postmortems start by affirming that everyone has good intentions, and does their best they can at the time, with the information they have at the time.
